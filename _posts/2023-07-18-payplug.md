SQL injection vulnerability in the Payplug (payplug) module for PrestaShop, in versions 3.6.0, 3.6.1, 3.6.2, 3.6.3, 3.7.0 and 3.7.1, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the `ajax.php` front controller.

## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-30153](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-30153)
* **Published at**: 2023-07-18
* **Advisory source**: Friends-Of-Presta.org
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: payplug
* **Impacted release**: 3.6.0,3.6.1,3.6.2,3.6.3,3.7.0,3.7.1 (fixed in 3.8.2)
* **Product author**: Payplug
* **Weakness**: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.8)

## Description

In the Payplug (payplug) module for PrestaShop, in versions 3.6.0, 3.6.1, 3.6.2, 3.6.3, 3.7.0 and 3.7.1 (fixed in 3.8.2), an HTTP request can be manipulated using `cart_id` GET parameter, in the `/module/payplug/ajax` FrontController endpoint, enabling a remote attacker to perform an SQL injection. The issue is fixed in version 3.8.2, published on July 2022. At our knowledge, there has been no public release between 3.7.1 and 3.8.2.

PayPlug communicated directly with their customers several times, informing them of the vulnerability and requesting that they upgrade the module to the latest known version. They also took action on their side to prevent customers from using a vulnerable version, requiring them to upgrade the version in order to continue using their service.

This exploit uses a PrestaShop front controller and most attackers can conceal the module controller’s path during the exploit so you will never know within your conventional frontend logs that it exploits this vulnerability. **You will only see “POST /” inside your conventional frontend logs**. Activating the AuditEngine of mod_security (or similar) is the only way to get data to confirm this exploit.

## Possible malicious usage

* Obtain admin access
* Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
* Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to FRONT to expose tokens and unlock admins's ajax scripts
* Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails

## Patch

**IMPORTANT**: PayPlug is now preventing customers using outdated versions from accessing their service. As a result, simply patching the module will not be enough to restore the service for those using older versions. An upgrade of the module is therefore necessary.

## Other recommandations

* It’s **highly recommended to upgrade the module** to the latest version or to **delete** the module if unused.
* Upgrade PrestaShop to the latest version to disable multiquery execution (separated by “;”) - be warned that this functionality **WILL NOT** protect your SHOP against injection SQL which uses the UNION clause to steal data.
* Change the default database prefix `ps_` by a new longer arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skills because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against these set of rules.
