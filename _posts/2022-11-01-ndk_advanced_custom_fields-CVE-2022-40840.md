## Patch

Added a tag-removing line after the setting of $content :

```
	$content = NdkCf::remove_script_tags($content);
```

Here is the function's content :

```
    public static function  remove_script_tags($html, $load = false){
        $dom = new DOMDocument();
        $dom->loadHTML($html);
        $script = $dom->getElementsByTagName('script');
    
        $remove = [];
        foreach($script as $item){
            $remove[] = $item;
        }
        //dump($remove);
    
        foreach ($remove as $item){
            $item->parentNode->removeChild($item);
        }
    
        $html = $dom->saveHTML();
        if($load){
            $html = preg_replace('/<!DOCTYPE.*?<html>.*?<body><p>/ims', '', $html);
            $html = str_replace('</p></body></html>', '', $html);
        }
        
        return $html;
    }
```

## Other recommendations

* Upgrade the module to the most recent version
* Upgrade PrestaShop to the latest version to disable multiquery executions (separated by “;”)
* Systematically escape characters ' " < and > by replacing them with HTML entities and applying strip_tags
* Limit to the strict minimum the length's value in database - a database field which allow 10 characters (varchar(10)) is far less dangerous than a field which allow 40+ characters (use cases which can exploit fragmented XSS payloads are very rare)
* Configure CSP headers (content security policies) by listing externals domains allowed to load assets (such as js files) or being called in XHR transactions (Ajax).
* If applicable: check against all your frontoffice's uploaders, uploading files which will be served by your server with mime type application/javascript (like every .js natively) must be strictly forbidden as it must be considered as dangerous as PHP files.
* Activate OWASP 941's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall) - be warn that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to preconfigure some bypasses against these set of rules.
