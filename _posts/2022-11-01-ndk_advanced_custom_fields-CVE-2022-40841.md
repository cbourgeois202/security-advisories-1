## Patch

Added a tag-removing line after the setting of $content :

```php
	$content = '<html><head><meta charset="utf-8">
        <style>
        '.Tools::file_get_contents(_PS_MODULE_DIR_.'ndk_advanced_custom_fields/views/css/ndkacf.css').'
        '.Tools::file_get_contents(Configuration::get('NDK_ACF_FONTS').'&effect=shadow-multiple|3d-float|fire').'
        </style>
            
        </head>';
    $content.= '<body style="position:relative;">';
    $content .= Tools::getValue('htmlNodes');
    $content.= '</body></html>';
    $content = NdkCf::remove_script_tags($content);
```

## Other recommendations

* Upgrade the module to the most recent version
* Upgrade PrestaShop to the latest version to disable multiquery executions (separated by “;”)
* Systematically escape characters ' " < and > by replacing them with HTML entities and applying strip_tags
* Limit to the strict minimum the length's value in database - a database field which allow 10 characters (varchar(10)) is far less dangerous than a field which allow 40+ characters (use cases which can exploit fragmented XSS payloads are very rare)
* Configure CSP headers (content security policies) by listing externals domains allowed to load assets (such as js files) or being called in XHR transactions (Ajax).
* If applicable: check against all your frontoffice's uploaders, uploading files which will be served by your server with mime type application/javascript (like every .js natively) must be strictly forbidden as it must be considered as dangerous as PHP files.
* Activate OWASP 941's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall) - be warn that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to preconfigure some bypasses against these set of rules.
